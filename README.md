# 📌 HealthCare-ChatBot  

The growing burden on healthcare systems due to rising patient demands, overworked medical staff, and resource constraints necessitates AI-driven solutions. Healthcare chatbots powered by **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)** provide instant access to medical information, assisting in **symptom assessment, condition prediction, and patient guidance** while reducing the workload on healthcare professionals.

## 🚀 Project Overview  

This study introduces a **hybrid AI model** combining **DeepSeek R1 fine-tuning** with a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system using **MiniLLM**. By leveraging **DeepSeek R1** for contextual medical understanding and **MiniLLM** for real-time retrieval of medical literature, the chatbot enhances response accuracy while minimizing hallucinations.

✅ Achieved an **accuracy of 95.22%** in medical query processing.  
✅ Attained a **BLEU score of 97.07%** for response quality.
